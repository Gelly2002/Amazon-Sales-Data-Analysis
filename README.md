Amazon Sales Performance Analysis (2020): $75.4M Revenue & Risk Mitigation

This project provides a full-stack Business Intelligence analysis of 2020 Amazon sales data. 
It validates the company's $75.4 million total revenue while uncovering two critical strategic issues: high revenue concentration risk on the "Sets" category, 
and a costly, recurring seasonal gap in March performance.

The repository contains all scripts and documentation detailing the methodology, from raw data cleaning (Excel) to interactive dashboard development (Power BI).
